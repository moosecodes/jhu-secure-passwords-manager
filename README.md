Self-paced Advanced Case Study: Build a Secure Password Manager
Introduction
Welcome to this advanced case study, where you will build a Secure Password Manager from scratch using Python. This project will challenge your ability to implement secure password storage, retrieval, and management while applying best practices in encryption and authentication.

Why is This Important?
Managing passwords securely is critical for businesses, financial institutions, and individuals. Weak password storage methods can lead to security breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access. Your task is to develop a password management system that ensures security and usability.

What You Need to Do
You will design and implement a command-line-based Password Manager that includes the following features:

Authentication System
Implement a user login system that requires authentication before accessing stored passwords.
Ensure secure credential verification to prevent unauthorized access.
Password Generation
Create a strong password generator that follows best security practices.
Allow users to either input their own passwords or generate secure ones automatically.
Password Retrieval & Management
Implement a retrieval system that allows users to securely access their stored passwords.
Allow users to update existing passwords or generate new ones if needed.
Provide a feature to delete passwords securely when no longer needed.
Logging & Security Measures
Maintain logs of user actions to track access and modifications.


Approach to Building the Password Manager
Use the following structured approach to implement your Password Generator and Manager:

Problem Breakdown - Steps Involved
Default Setup

Create default password storage files for testing.
Set up an initial structure for authentication and encryption.
Password Generation

Build functions to generate random passwords based on length and complexity requirements.
Ensure passwords include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters for enhanced security.
Password Manager Functionalities

Helper Methods: Implement functions to read/write passwords and logs securely.
Add Password: Enable users to add a new password manually or auto-generate a secure 12-digit password for a domain.
Retrieve Password: Allow users to view stored passwords securely.
Update Password: Provide the option to update or auto-generate a new password for an existing domain.
Delete Password: Implement a feature to remove a password when no longer needed.
Main Function

Centralize all functionalities into a menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
Ensure secure user interactions with proper encryption and validation checks.
